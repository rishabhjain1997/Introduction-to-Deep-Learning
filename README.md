The goal of this course is to give learners basic understanding of modern neural networks and their applications in computer vision and natural language understanding. The course starts with a recap of linear models and discussion of stochastic optimization methods that are crucial for training deep neural networks. We study all popular building blocks of neural networks including fully connected layers, convolutional and recurrent layers as part of this course. 
We will also use these building blocks to define complex modern architectures in TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. In the course project we will implement deep neural network for the task of image captioning which solves the problem of giving a text description for an input image.
